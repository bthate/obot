| Welcome to OBOT, the 24/7 channel daemon ! see https://pypi.org/project/obot/ 

| OBOT is a bot based on the OLIB and OMOD packages.
| OLIB is a object library and uses timestamped, type in filename, JSON stringified, files on filesystem backend.
| OMOD is a package of modules for the OLIB library and provides RSS feed fetching, UDP to IRC gateway and is self programmable.

| OLIB,OMOD and OBOT have been placed in the Public Domain and contain no copyright or LICENSE, this makes OBOT truely free (pastable) code you can use how you see fit, 

OBOT can serve as a 24/7 background daaemon in an IRC channel, it can work as a UDP to IRC relay, has user management to limit access to prefered users and 
can run as a service to let it restart after reboots. 

installation is through pypi:

 > sudo pip3 install obot --upgrade --force-reinstall

you can also run directly from the tarball, see https://pypi.org/project/obot/#files


USAGE
=====

OBOT has it's own CLI, you can run it by giving the obot command on the
prompt, it will return with no response:

:: 

 $ obot
 $ 

you can use obot <cmd> to run a command directly:

::

 $ obot cmds
 cfg|cmd|dne|edt|fnd|flt|krn|log|add|tsk|tdo|udp|upt|ver

configuration is done with the cfg command:

::

 $ obot icfg
 channel=#obot nick=obot port=6667 server=localhost

you can use setters to edit fields in a configuration:

::

 $ obot icfg server=irc.freenode.net channel=\#dunkbots nick=obot
 channel=#dunkbots nick=botje port=6667 server=irc.freenode.net

to start a irc server with the cmd and opr modules loaded and a console
running:

::

 $ obot mods=irc,csl,cmd,opr
 > tsk
 0 0s       Console.input
 1 0s       IRC.handler
 2 0s       IRC.input
 3 0s       IRC.output
 4 0s       Kernel.handler
 > 

RSS
===

OBOT provides with the use of feedparser the possibility to server rss
feeds in your channel. adding rss to mods= will load the rss modules and
start it's poller.

::

 $ obot mods=rss

to add an url use the rss command with an url:

::

 $ obot rss https://github.com/bthate/obot/commits/master.atom
 ok 1

run the rss command to see what urls are registered:

::

 $ obot fnd rss
 0 https://github.com/bthate/obot/commits/master.atom

the fetch command can be used to poll the added feeds:

::

 $ obot fetch
 fetched 0

UDP
===

OBOT also has the possibility to serve as a UDP to IRC relay where you
can send UDP packages to the bot and have txt displayed on the channel.

use the obot program to send text via the bot to the channel on the irc server:

::

 $ tail -f /var/log/syslog | obot udp

to send the tail output to the IRC channel

you can use python3 code to send a UDP packet to obot, it's unencrypted
txt send to the bot and display on the joined channels.

to send a udp packet to okbot in python3:

::

 import socket

 def toudp(host=localhost, port=5500, txt=""):
     sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
     sock.sendto(bytes(txt.strip(), "utf-8"), host, port)

if you want to run the bot 24/7 you can install OBOT as a service for
the systemd daemon. You can do this by copying the following into
the /etc/systemd/system/obot.service file:

::


 [Unit]
 Description=24/7 channel daemon
 After=network-online.target
 Wants=network-online.target

 [Service]
 User=obot
 Group=obot
 ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/obotd

 [Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target

create a homedir for obot:

::

 $ mkdir /home/obot
 $ mkdir /home/obot/.obot
 $ mkdir /home/obot/.obot/omod

add the obot user to the system:

::

 $ groupadd obot
 $ chown -R obot:obot /home/obot
 $ useradd obot -d /home/obot
 $ passwd obot

configure obot to connect to irc:

::

 $ sudo -u obot obot cfg server=irc.freenode.net channel=#obot nick=obot

copy modules over to obot's work directory:

 $ cp -Ra mods/*.py /home/obot/.obot/omod

make sure permissions are set properly:

 $ chown -R obot:obot /home/obot
 $ chown -R obot:obot /home/obot/.obot
 $ chmod -R 700 /home/obot/.obot/omod/
 $ chmod -R 400 /home/obot/.obot/omod/*.py

add the obot service with:

::

 $ sudo systemctl enable obot
 $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

then restart the obot service.
